## üèóÔ∏è VERIFIED ARCHITECTURE

### **Google ADK Framework** (User-Confirmed)
Platform will be built using Google Agent Development Kit (ADK) for multi-agent orchestration.

### **Research-Approved ADK Agent Structure**
Based on approved subagent research findings:

**5 Specialized ADK Agents:**
1. **Orchestrator Agent** - Coordinates entire workflow, manages tenant context
2. **Business Classification Agent** - Industry detection and classification
3. **Knowledge Extraction Agent** - Multi-source data extraction with confidence scoring
4. **Validation Agent** - HITL validation workflow management
5. **Deployment Agent** - ElevenLabs voice agent creation and Twilio integration

### **Research-Approved Supporting Concepts:**
- Multi-tenant data isolation with row-level security
- Real-time progress updates to UI
- Industry classification using commercial APIs with ML fallbacks
- Multi-layer confidence scoring for extracted data
