2. **Green**: Write minimal code to make test pass
3. **Refactor**: Improve code while maintaining test pass
4. **Commit**: Save progress with meaningful commit message

### Commit Strategy:
- **After every task completion**: Individual commit with task reference
- **After every 5 tasks**: Combined commit with "Tasks X-Y complete"
- **After every 10 tasks**: Push to main branch with comprehensive testing

### Testing Requirements:
- **Unit Tests**: All business logic and service functions
- **Integration Tests**: All API endpoints and external service interactions
- **Contract Tests**: All API contracts and data schemas
- **End-to-End Tests**: Critical user workflows and agent creation pipeline
- **Performance Tests**: Load testing for high-traffic scenarios

### Quality Gates:
- All tests must pass before task completion
- Code coverage must maintain 80% minimum
- No security vulnerabilities in dependencies
- Performance benchmarks must be met
- Documentation must be updated for API changes

This task breakdown provides a comprehensive development roadmap with TDD methodology, ensuring robust testing coverage and systematic feature development.
