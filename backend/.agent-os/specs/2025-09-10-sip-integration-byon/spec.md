# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: SIP Integration / Bring Your Own Number (BYON)
> Created: 2025-09-10
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement SIP trunking integration that allows customers to use their existing business phone numbers with the Voice Agent Platform. This eliminates the need to change established business numbers and provides a major competitive advantage over platforms that force number changes.

## Business Justification

**Current Problem**: The platform only supports Twilio-purchased numbers, forcing customers to abandon their established business phone numbers. This creates significant friction for:
- Restaurants with memorable numbers like (555) PIZZA-11
- Small businesses with branded phone numbers in marketing materials
- Enterprises with existing PBX infrastructure investments

**Market Opportunity**: This is a major competitive differentiator - most voice AI platforms force customers to change numbers. BYON capability positions us as enterprise-ready and customer-centric.

**Business Impact**: 
- Eliminates the #1 customer objection during sales
- Enables enterprise customer acquisition
- Allows hybrid deployments (existing + new numbers)
- Reduces customer acquisition costs

## User Stories

### Primary: Restaurant Owner with Memorable Number

As a restaurant owner, I want to keep using my established number (555) PIZZA-11 while adding AI voice capabilities, so that I don't lose customers who have memorized my number and don't need to update all my marketing materials.

**Detailed Workflow:**
1. Customer signs up for voice agent platform
2. During onboarding, selects "Use My Existing Number" option
3. Enters their current business phone number
4. Platform guides through SIP trunk setup process
5. Customer provides SIP provider credentials or chooses recommended provider
6. System configures call routing: existing number → SIP trunk → voice agent
7. Customer tests integration with sample calls
8. Goes live with existing number powered by AI voice agent

**Success Criteria:**
- Customer retains their established phone number
- All calls to existing number are handled by voice agent
- No service interruption during setup
- Marketing materials remain unchanged

### Secondary: Small Business Hybrid Setup

As a small business owner, I want to use both my existing main number for the AI agent and get additional Twilio numbers for different departments, so that I can gradually expand my voice AI implementation.

**Detailed Workflow:**
1. Customer configures existing main number via BYON/SIP
2. Provisions additional Twilio numbers for specific use cases
3. Routes different number types to different agents or services
4. Manages all numbers from unified dashboard
5. Scales voice AI across business operations

**Success Criteria:**
- Unified management of mixed number types
- Flexible routing configuration
- Seamless customer experience across all numbers

### Tertiary: Enterprise PBX Integration

As an enterprise IT director, I want to connect our existing PBX system to the voice agent platform, so that we can add AI capabilities without replacing our phone infrastructure.

**Detailed Workflow:**
1. Customer has existing PBX system with multiple numbers
2. Configures SIP trunk between PBX and voice agent platform
3. Routes specific extensions or numbers to AI agents
4. Maintains existing employee extensions and internal routing
5. Adds AI capabilities for customer-facing numbers only

**Success Criteria:**
- Integration with existing PBX systems
- Selective AI routing (some numbers to AI, others to humans)
- No disruption to internal phone operations

## Spec Scope

1. **SIP Trunk Service** - Core service for managing SIP connections and call routing from external numbers
2. **SIP Configuration Management** - API endpoints and database schema for storing SIP trunk configurations per tenant
3. **Enhanced Phone Service** - Extended phone service supporting both Twilio-native and SIP-connected numbers
4. **BYON Onboarding Wizard** - Frontend wizard guiding customers through the process of connecting existing numbers
5. **SIP Validation System** - Real-time validation of SIP credentials and connectivity testing
6. **Call Routing Enhancement** - Enhanced call routing to handle multiple number sources (Twilio + SIP)
7. **SIP Monitoring Dashboard** - Monitoring and health checks for SIP trunk connections
8. **Multi-Provider Support** - Support for common SIP providers (initially focus on major providers)

## Out of Scope

- Full PBX replacement functionality
- Advanced telephony features (call parking, conference bridging)
- SMS/MMS support via SIP (voice calls only in v1)
- Integration with legacy analog phone systems
- Custom SIP provider development

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Functional SIP Integration** - Customers can successfully route calls from their existing numbers through SIP trunks to voice agents
2. **Complete BYON Wizard** - Frontend wizard that guides customers through SIP setup with validation and testing
3. **SIP Management Dashboard** - Customers can monitor SIP trunk status, view call logs, and modify configurations
4. **Multi-Number Support** - Platform seamlessly handles mixed environments with both SIP and Twilio numbers
5. **Production-Ready Deployment** - SIP integration works reliably in production with proper error handling and monitoring
