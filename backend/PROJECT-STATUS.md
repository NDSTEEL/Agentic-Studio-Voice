# Voice Agent Platform - Project Status

## Current State ($(date))
- Location: /mnt/c/Users/avibm/Agentic-Studio-Voice/
- GitHub: https://github.com/Avi7702/Agentic-Studio-Voice
- Progress: T007/72 complete (9.7%)
- Approach: Spec-kit with proper TDD + Mock Registry

## Completed Tasks
- T001: Project Structure ✓
- T002: Database Models (TDD) ✓
- T003: Connection Management (100% after fixing) ✓
- T004: Authentication Middleware (21/21 tests) ✓
- T005: Basic API Structure (16/16 tests) ✓
- T006: Tenant Management API (18/18 tests, 6 mocks) ✓
- T007: Basic Frontend Setup (27/27 tests, 7 mocks) ✓

## Key Decisions
1. Using REAL spec-kit (not custom framework)
2. Proper TDD: Red → Green → Commit
3. MOCK_REGISTRY.md tracks ALL technical debt
4. Commit every 5 tasks, push every 10
5. NO shortcuts - 100% tests before proceeding

## Technical Setup
- Backend: FastAPI with PostgreSQL
- Frontend: Next.js 14 with TypeScript
- Testing: pytest (backend), vitest (frontend)
- Docker: Development environment ready
- Dependencies: All critical packages installed

## Known Issues & Solutions
- pip timeouts → using --break-system-packages
- 13 total mocks documented → see MOCK_REGISTRY.md
- Integration tests needed before production

## Next Tasks
- T008: Authentication UI
- T009: Docker Development Environment
- T010: CI/CD Pipeline Setup (PUSH TO GITHUB)
- T011-T072: Continue per tasks.md

## How to Continue
cd /mnt/c/Users/avibm/Agentic-Studio-Voice/
Check current task: grep -n "^T008" tasks.md
Continue with: Execute T008 following TDD pattern
